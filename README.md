# HYPER-PONG

## About
### This is my take on the old class game of pong.
I've taken some liberties in not constructing a perfect recreation of the classic. The game's been constructed my current skill level in JavaScript. 
### Play 
Click on the "environment" link with the little rocket icon.
Click on the top-most "view deployment" button below and it should open up the game in another window.
#### OR
You can download the zipped file.
Once the file is downloaded, just unzip/extract, and you can open the index.html file in a browser. It should work fine.
#### Alternatively
You can just clone this repository.

#### Current Features
	* Custom graphics(title screen art, paddles) build in Pyxel Edit. : https://www.pyxeledit.com/
	* Custom sounds from Bfxr(chip sound generator/editor) : https://www.bfxr.net/
	* Basic game states: menu, play, pause, score, win


#### For the Future
	* Multi-ball mode 
	* Adding spin to ball upon return
	* Perhaps a mini cannon mounted to each player's paddle that can shoot;
	 bullets that hit the other player's paddle shorten their paddle.


#### Challenges
	* I spend two days learning about how States work and how to impliment them in my game. It's greatly helped my understanding a games and programming in general.

	* I struggled with how to properly split particular parts of code into separate files. This was due to some confusion over the rules of how a document is loaded/executed.

	* After building the basics of the game I took some time learning to better utilize object, constructors, and ES6 classes. It's paid off.\

	* Figuring out how to employ the Module Design pattern
